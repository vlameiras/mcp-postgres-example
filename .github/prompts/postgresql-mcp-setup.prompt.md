# PostgreSQL Docker Compose + MCP Server Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of a local PostgreSQL database setup using Docker Compose, along with a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI models with secure, real-time access to the PostgreSQL database. The MCP server will act as a bridge between AI clients and the database, enabling natural language queries and data retrieval without the need for pre-processed embeddings or vector databases.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **PostgreSQL Database**: A containerized PostgreSQL instance with persistent data storage
- **MCP Server**: A server implementing the Model Context Protocol for database access
- **Network Connectivity**: Internal Docker networking between services
- **Data Persistence**: PostgreSQL data must survive container restarts
- **Security**: Secure database credentials and controlled access
- **API Access**: RESTful HTTP interface for MCP server interactions

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Sub-second response times for typical database queries
- **Reliability**: Services should restart automatically on failure
- **Scalability**: Architecture should support future horizontal scaling
- **Maintainability**: Clear configuration and documented setup process
- **Compatibility**: Support for standard PostgreSQL clients and MCP protocol

### Technical Requirements
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- PostgreSQL 16 or later
- MCP server supporting read-only operations initially
- HTTP/JSON API for MCP interactions
- Environment-based configuration

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

#### Step 1.1: Create Project Structure
- Create project directory structure
- Initialize version control (git)
- Create necessary configuration directories

#### Step 1.2: Docker Compose Configuration
- Define PostgreSQL service with:
  - Official PostgreSQL 16 image
  - Environment variables for database credentials
  - Port mapping (5432:5432)
  - Named volume for data persistence
  - Restart policy for reliability

#### Step 1.3: Database Configuration
- Configure initial database, user, and password
- Set up persistent volume mounting
- Configure PostgreSQL settings for optimal performance

### Phase 2: MCP Server Integration

#### Step 2.1: MCP Server Selection
- Research and select appropriate MCP server implementation
- Evaluate options:
  - `ipfans/postgres-mcp` (lightweight, read-only)
  - `crystaldba/postgres-mcp` (advanced features)
  - Custom implementation if needed

#### Step 2.2: MCP Server Configuration
- Configure MCP server service in docker-compose
- Set database connection string using internal Docker networking
- Configure HTTP port mapping (8080:8080)
- Implement proper service dependencies

#### Step 2.3: Service Communication
- Configure internal Docker network for service-to-service communication
- Set up proper service discovery using Docker DNS
- Implement health checks and readiness probes

### Phase 3: Security and Access Control

#### Step 3.1: Database Security
- Configure strong database passwords
- Implement database user with limited privileges
- Set up connection limits and timeout configurations

#### Step 3.2: MCP Server Security
- Configure read-only access initially
- Implement request validation and sanitization
- Set up proper error handling and logging

#### Step 3.3: Network Security
- Configure internal-only communication between services
- Expose only necessary ports to host
- Consider adding reverse proxy for production use

### Phase 4: Documentation and Examples

#### Step 4.1: Usage Documentation
- Create comprehensive README with setup instructions
- Document environment variables and configuration options
- Provide troubleshooting guide

#### Step 4.2: API Examples
- Create example curl commands for MCP server interactions
- Document common query patterns
- Provide sample database schema and data

#### Step 4.3: Integration Examples
- Show how to connect AI clients to MCP server
- Provide examples for different use cases
- Document best practices for query optimization

### Phase 5: Monitoring and Maintenance

#### Step 5.1: Health Monitoring
- Implement health check endpoints for both services
- Configure Docker health checks
- Set up basic logging and monitoring

#### Step 5.2: Backup Strategy
- Configure automated database backups
- Document backup and restore procedures
- Test disaster recovery scenarios

#### Step 5.3: Update Procedures
- Document service update procedures
- Configure automated security updates where appropriate
- Create rollback procedures

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- **MCP Server Connectivity**: Verify MCP server can connect to PostgreSQL
- **Database Operations**: Test basic CRUD operations through MCP server
- **Configuration Validation**: Verify all environment variables are properly loaded
- **Error Handling**: Test graceful handling of database connection failures

### Integration Tests
- **Service Startup**: Verify both services start in correct order with dependencies
- **Network Communication**: Test internal Docker networking between services
- **Data Persistence**: Verify data survives container restarts
- **Port Mapping**: Confirm external access to exposed ports

### API Tests
- **Health Endpoints**: Test health check endpoints for both services
- **MCP Protocol**: Verify MCP server responds correctly to protocol requests
- **Database Queries**: Test various SQL query patterns through MCP server
- **Resource Listing**: Verify ability to list database tables and schemas

### Performance Tests
- **Query Response Time**: Measure response times for typical queries
- **Concurrent Connections**: Test multiple simultaneous connections
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor CPU and memory usage under load
- **Data Volume**: Test with realistic data volumes

### Security Tests
- **Access Control**: Verify unauthorized access is properly blocked
- **SQL Injection**: Test protection against malicious SQL queries
- **Connection Limits**: Verify proper handling of connection exhaustion
- **Credential Management**: Ensure secrets are properly protected

### End-to-End Tests
- **Complete Workflow**: Test full cycle from service startup to query execution
- **AI Client Integration**: Test actual AI model connection and interaction
- **Failure Recovery**: Test service recovery from various failure scenarios
- **Data Consistency**: Verify data integrity across service restarts

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Service Dependencies**: Use proper dependency ordering and health checks
- **Data Loss**: Implement persistent volumes and backup procedures
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular updates and security scanning
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Monitor and optimize query performance

### Operational Risks
- **Configuration Errors**: Comprehensive validation and testing
- **Network Issues**: Proper error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Implement resource limits and monitoring
- **Version Compatibility**: Pin specific image versions in production

## Success Criteria

- PostgreSQL database accessible via standard clients
- MCP server successfully connects to and queries PostgreSQL
- All services start reliably with single docker-compose command
- API responds correctly to MCP protocol requests
- Data persists across container restarts
- Comprehensive documentation enables easy setup by others
